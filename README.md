How to run the program:
-
* In the main() function, there is a loop for i in range(0, x). Change the value of x to specify the amount of sets you'd like the program to run. Set by default to 10 because of the assignment requirements for scoreboard
* To manually enter configurations by using the console, uncomment the line with the receive_input() function call in main() and uncomment the g.place_blocs() function call in main while commenting out g.auto_blocs() and the line after the receive_inputs() line.
* Do the vice-versa if you'd like to pre-enter the configuration yourself in the code (recommended to do this especially if running more than one set of games)
* Run the main function in skeleton-tictactoe.py (recommended to use pypy3)
* When the program completes, it will create output files so you can read the results and how the game played out! The files generated are gameTrace-nbst.txt and scoreboard.txt (check the very last batch of info in scoreboard for the latest inserted scoreboard)
